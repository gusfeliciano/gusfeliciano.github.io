## Introduction

Cloud-native development leverages the power of cloud computing to build scalable and resilient applications. In this comprehensive guide, we'll walk through the process of creating a cloud-native website using various AWS services. We'll start with hosting a static website and progressively add dynamic features, including a visitor counter. This article is perfect for beginners who want to understand how different AWS services work together to create a fully functional, scalable website.

## Setting Up a Static Website with S3

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is an object storage service that we can use to host static websites. Here's how to set it up:

1. Create an S3 bucket:
   - Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to S3.
   - Click "Create bucket" and choose a globally unique name.
   - In the bucket settings, enable "Static website hosting".
   - Set the index document to "index.html".

2. Upload your website files:
   - Upload your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to the bucket.
   - Ensure the files have public read permissions.

3. Configure bucket policy:
   - In the bucket permissions, add a bucket policy to allow public read access:

   ```json
   {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Principal": "*",
               "Action": "s3:GetObject",
               "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

   Replace "your-bucket-name" with your actual bucket name.

## Securing the Website with CloudFront

CloudFront is AWS's Content Delivery Network (CDN) service. We'll use it to serve our website over HTTPS and improve performance:

1. Create a CloudFront distribution:
   - In the AWS Console, go to CloudFront and click "Create Distribution".
   - Set the origin domain to your S3 bucket's website endpoint.
   - Enable "Redirect HTTP to HTTPS".

2. Configure SSL/TLS certificate:
   - Use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to create a free SSL/TLS certificate for your domain.
   - In your CloudFront distribution settings, select this certificate.

3. Set up Origin Access Identity (OAI):
   - Create an OAI and associate it with your distribution.
   - Update your S3 bucket policy to only allow access from this OAI.

## Configuring DNS with Route 53

Route 53 is AWS's Domain Name System (DNS) web service. We'll use it to map our domain name to our CloudFront distribution:

1. Create a hosted zone:
   - In Route 53, create a hosted zone for your domain.

2. Update name servers:
   - If your domain is registered elsewhere, update the name servers at your registrar to use Route 53's name servers.

3. Create record sets:
   - Create an A record for your domain, aliasing it to your CloudFront distribution.
   - If needed, create a CNAME record for www subdomain.

## Implementing a Visitor Counter

For our visitor counter, we'll use a serverless architecture with DynamoDB, Lambda, and API Gateway.

### DynamoDB for Data Storage

DynamoDB is a NoSQL database service. We'll use it to store our visitor count:

1. Create a DynamoDB table:
   - Name: "VisitorCount"
   - Partition key: "id" (String)
   - Add an item with id "visitors" and an attribute "count" set to 0.

### Lambda for Backend Logic

Lambda allows us to run code without provisioning servers. Our Lambda function will update the visitor count:

1. Create a Lambda function:
   - Runtime: Node.js 20.x
   - Code:

   ```javascript
   const { DynamoDBClient, UpdateItemCommand } = require('@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb');
   
   const client = new DynamoDBClient();
   
   exports.handler = async (event) => {
       const params = {
           TableName: process.env.TABLE_NAME,
           Key: { id: { S: 'visitors' } },
           UpdateExpression: 'ADD visitorCount :inc',
           ExpressionAttributeValues: { ':inc': { N: '1' } },
           ReturnValues: 'UPDATED_NEW'
       };
   
       try {
           const command = new UpdateItemCommand(params);
           const data = await client.send(command);
           
           const visitorCount = data.Attributes.visitorCount.N;
   
           return {
               statusCode: 200,
               headers: {
                   "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "https://yourdomain.com",
                   "Access-Control-Allow-Headers": "Content-Type",
                   "Access-Control-Allow-Methods": "OPTIONS,POST"
               },
               body: JSON.stringify({ visitorCount: parseInt(visitorCount) })
           };
       } catch (error) {
           console.error('Error:', error);
           return {
               statusCode: 500,
               headers: {
                   "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "https://yourdomain.com",
                   "Access-Control-Allow-Headers": "Content-Type",
                   "Access-Control-Allow-Methods": "OPTIONS,POST"
               },
               body: JSON.stringify({ error: 'Failed to update visitor count' })
           };
       }
   };
   ```

2. Set up environment variables:
   - Add TABLE_NAME environment variable with your DynamoDB table name.

3. Configure permissions:
   - Give the Lambda function permission to read/write to your DynamoDB table.

### API Gateway for HTTP Endpoints

API Gateway allows us to create, publish, and manage APIs. We'll use it to expose our Lambda function:

1. Create a new API:
   - Choose HTTP API type.

2. Create a resource and method:
   - Create a resource named "visitorcount".
   - Add a POST method to this resource, integrating it with your Lambda function.

3. Enable CORS:
   - In the API settings, enable CORS for your domain.

4. Deploy the API:
   - Create a new stage (e.g., "prod") and deploy your API.

## Frontend JavaScript Integration

Now, let's integrate our backend with the frontend:

1. Add HTML for the visitor counter:

   ```html
   <div id="visitor-count">Visitors: <span id="count">0</span></div>
   ```

2. Add JavaScript to call our API:

   ```javascript
   function updateVisitorCount() {
       fetch('https://your-api-gateway-url/visitorcount', {
           method: 'POST',
           headers: {
               'Content-Type': 'application/json'
           },
           mode: 'cors'
       })
       .then(response => response.json())
       .then(data => {
           document.getElementById('count').textContent = data.visitorCount;
       })
       .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
   }

   document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', updateVisitorCount);
   ```

   Replace 'https://your-api-gateway-url' with your actual API Gateway URL.

## Testing the JavaScript Code

To ensure our JavaScript works correctly, we'll add some tests:

1. Install Jest for testing:
   ```
   npm install --save-dev jest
   ```

2. Create a test file (e.g., `visitorCounter.test.js`):

   ```javascript
   // Mock fetch function
   global.fetch = jest.fn(() =>
     Promise.resolve({
       json: () => Promise.resolve({ visitorCount: 5 }),
     })
   );

   // Import the function to test
   const { updateVisitorCount } = require('./visitorCounter');

   test('updates visitor count correctly', async () => {
     // Set up our document body
     document.body.innerHTML = '<div id="count">0</div>';

     // Call the function
     await updateVisitorCount();

     // Check that the count was updated
     expect(document.getElementById('count').textContent).toBe('5');
   });
   ```

3. Run the tests:
   ```
   npx jest
   ```

## Conclusion

In this guide, we've covered how to build a cloud-native website using various AWS services. We've implemented a static website with S3, secured it with CloudFront, set up DNS with Route 53, and created a serverless backend with DynamoDB, Lambda, and API Gateway.

This architecture provides a scalable, secure, and cost-effective solution for hosting websites and web applications. As you become more comfortable with these services, you can expand on this foundation to build even more complex and feature-rich applications.

In the next article, we'll explore how to automate the deployment of this website using CI/CD practices with GitHub Actions.
